# CloudBees Smart Tests Workshop

Welcome to the CloudBees Smart Tests Workshop! This hands-on session is designed to help you implement predictive test selection and analysis within your Git repositories. Throughout this workshop, you'll optimize your test pipeline to ensure that only the most relevant tests are executed with every code change.

## Goals

- Understand the core concepts of Predictive Test Selection (PTS)
- Manage builds and test sessions effectively
- Implement targeted subsetting of tests for code changes
- Experiment with various test categories
